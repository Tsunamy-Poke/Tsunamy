        I'm Tsunamy,a rhythm game player.My primary focus is on playing Arcaea,
        but I also enjoy dabbling in other rhythm games such as Paradigm: Reboot
        and Phigros from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself a well-rounded player, currently holding a potential
        (ptt) of 12.82 in Arcaea.

        One of the aspects I love most about music games is delving into the
        intricacies of the charts and discovering unique approaches and
        techniques that suit my playstyle.On the other hand, I enjoy the music
        very much. They are full of emotion and story, which make me
        intoxicated.
